## üöÄ How to use

> `npx create-expo my-app --example with-reanimated`

- Run `yarn` or `npm install`
- Run `yarn start` or `npm run start` to try it out.

## üìù Notes

- [`react-native-reanimated` docs](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/)

## Develop the Game Engine

### 1. Player Plane & Movement
- Render the player's spaceship at the bottom of the screen
- Implement touch or drag controls to move the player left/right
- Display the player's position visually

### 2. Background Stars
- Add a simple animated starfield background
- Stars should move downward to create a sense of motion

### 3. Enemy Ships
- Render basic enemy ships at the top of the screen
- Make them move downward at a constant speed
- No shooting or collision yet

### 4. Player Shooting
- Allow the player to shoot bullets upward by tapping or holding a button
- Render bullets and make them move upward

### 5. Enemy Collisions & Scoring
- Detect collisions between player bullets and enemy ships
- Remove hit enemies and increment the score

### 6. Player Health
- Detect collisions between ennemies and player + reduce health when it happens

### 7. Game Over & Restart
- End the game when the player's health reaches zero
- Show a game over screen and allow restarting

### 8. Audio Effects
- Add haptic feedback on player collisions
- Add sound effects

### 9. Visual Effects
- Add explosion animations
- Polish UI elements


## Extra 
### A. Add power-ups
- Create bonus elements that player can catch
- These bonus adds power to his ship for some limited time (it changes the fired ammo munition type : missiles, ...)

### B. Enemy Shooting
- Make enemies shoot bullets downward

# Features

## Collision Spark Effect
The collision spark effect creates a visually stunning yellow/white spark animation when an enemy ship collides with the player ship, providing immediate visual feedback for player damage.

### Visual Characteristics
- **Color Palette**: Yellow (#ffff00), light yellow (#ffff80), white (#ffffff), cream (#fffacd), khaki (#f0e68c), and gold (#ffd700)
- **Particle Count**: Configurable (15-20 main particles + 8 small particles)
- **Duration**: Configurable (600ms - 1000ms animation cycle)
- **Effects**: 
  - Flash effect at collision point (optional)
  - Multiple spark particles radiating outward
  - Smooth fade-out effect as animation progresses
  - Configurable particle sizes and speeds

### Technical Implementation

#### Components
1. **CollisionSparkEffect.tsx**: Core spark rendering component using Skia
2. **CollisionSparkOverlay.tsx**: Animation management and overlay rendering
3. **collisionSparkConfigs.ts**: Configuration system with type-safe enum for different spark effects
4. **GameObjectsStore.ts**: State management for collision sparks
5. **GameScreen.tsx**: Integration with main game interface

#### Animation Features
- **Type-Safe Configuration**: Enum-based configuration system (CollisionSparkType.DEFAULT, INTENSE, SUBTLE)
- **Configurable Effects**: Multiple preset configurations with full TypeScript support
- **Smooth Animation**: 60fps animation with proper cleanup
- **Layered Effects**: Flash + main sparks + small sparks for depth
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient particle rendering with Skia
- **Flexible Duration**: Configurable animation duration per effect type

#### Integration Points
- **Collision Detection**: Automatically triggered in `checkPlayerEnemyCollisions`
- **State Management**: Integrated with existing game object store
- **Cleanup**: Automatic removal when animation completes
- **Z-Index**: Renders above game elements but below UI (z-index: 60)

### Usage
The collision spark effect automatically triggers when:
1. An enemy ship collides with the player ship
2. Player health is decremented
3. Collision sound and haptic feedback are triggered

The effect appears at the player's current position and provides immediate visual feedback for the collision event.

## Special Missile Feature
The special missile feature adds an interactive button to the bottom-right corner of the game screen that allows players to fire powerful special missiles.

### How It Works

#### Button Interaction
- **Long Press**: Hold down the special missile button to start charging
- **Circular Progress**: A circular progress bar fills around the button as it charges
- **Visual Feedback**: 
  - Button glows orange while charging
  - Button turns green when fully charged
  - Progress bar shows charging status
- **Haptic Feedback**: 
  - Light vibration when charging starts
  - Medium vibration when charging is cancelled
  - Success vibration when fully charged
  - Heavy vibration when special missile is fired

#### Special Missile Properties
- **Damage**: 3x damage compared to regular bullets (3 vs 1)
- **Speed**: 20% faster than regular bullets (600 vs 500 pixels/second)
- **Size**: Larger radius than regular bullets (10 vs 6 pixels)
- **Color**: Orange (#ff6b35) instead of yellow
- **Sound**: Louder sound effect when fired

### Technical Implementation

##### Components
1. **SpecialMissileButton.tsx**: Main button component with circular progress
2. **GameScreen.tsx**: Integration with game logic
3. **GameRenderer.tsx**: Visual rendering of special missiles
4. **types.ts**: Extended bullet type definitions

#### Key Features
- **Gesture Handling**: Uses react-native-gesture-handler for long press detection
- **Skia Graphics**: Circular progress bar rendered with Skia
- **State Management**: Proper cleanup and state management for charging
- **Audio Integration**: Special sound effects for the feature
- **Haptic Feedback**: Multiple haptic feedback points for better UX

#### Charging Mechanics
- **Charge Time**: 2 seconds to fully charge
- **Progress Updates**: 50ms intervals for smooth visual feedback
- **Auto-Trigger**: Automatically fires when fully charged
- **Cancellation**: Releasing before full charge cancels the action

## Usage
1. Long press the special missile button (bottom-right corner)
2. Hold until the circular progress bar fills completely
3. The special missile will automatically fire
4. The button resets and can be used again

## Future Enhancements
- Cooldown period between uses
- Multiple special missile types
- Power-up system integration
- Visual effects for special missile trails
- Different charging times based on game difficulty
